## Models Implemented

- **Baseline Models**: Naive, Mean, Drift, Seasonal Naive
- **Exponential Smoothing**: SES, Holt, Holt-Winters
- **ARIMA (9,1,9)**: Parameterized manually after ADF and ACF/PACF analysis
- **Prophet**: Trend-focused model with automatic changepoint detection
- **RNN & LSTM**: Deep learning models for non-linear temporal modeling

---

## Evaluation Metrics

Model performance was evaluated using:
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**
- **MAPE / sMAPE**
- **MASE (Mean Absolute Scaled Error)**

Visual comparison plots and metric tables highlight LSTM as the most accurate model on the test set.

> Note:
Some evaluation metric values presented in this report may slightly differ from those in the original notebook. This is due to the notebook being reloaded at a later stage, which can introduce variability in model predictionsâ€”especially for stochastic methods like RNN and LSTM. These changes do not affect the overall conclusions or model rankings but may lead to minor numerical differences in reported metrics.
